# IVA-Calculator
My first Python script. It's a very simple python file that takes input from the and multiplies it by 11.5%, which is the tax (IVA) in Puerto Rico. The script only accepts numbers, so don't try to input any text or symbols when it asks you to.

#Running The Script
To run, simply open Terminal and run ```python IVA-Calc.py```
