# IVA & Tip Calculator
My first Python script. It's a very simple python file that takes input from the user and multiplies it by 11.5%, which is the tax (IVA) in Puerto Rico. After this, it will ask if the user wants to add a tip, and if the user says yes it will ask what percent that tip will be.

#Running The Script
To run, simply open Terminal and run ```python IVA-Calc.py```
